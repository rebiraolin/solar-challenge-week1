# Solar Data Discovery Challenge: Final Report

## Introduction
This report summarizes the data exploration and analysis performed for the Solar Data Discovery Challenge, focusing on solar irradiance data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Highlights

### Benin
* **Data Loaded:** `benin-malanville.csv`
* **Key Findings:** [Briefly mention 1-2 points, e.g., "Identified X missing values in Y columns," "Observed Z outliers in GHI/DNI," "Timestamp handling completed."]

### Sierra Leone
* **Data Loaded:** `sierraleone-bumbuna.csv`
* **Key Findings:** [Briefly mention 1-2 points, e.g., "Similar data structure to Benin," "Handled specific outliers in WS/WSgust," "Comments column entirely null and dropped."]

### Togo
* **Data Loaded:** `togo-dapaong_qc.csv`
* **Key Findings:** [Briefly mention 1-2 points, e.g., "Consistent data quality for key solar variables," "Processed GHI spikes effectively," "Cleaned data ready for comparison."]

## Cross-Country Comparison (Task 3)
* **Methodology:** Loaded cleaned data for all three countries and compared GHI patterns.
* **Observations:** [Briefly state 1-2 comparisons, e.g., "Benin and Togo showed similar daily GHI peaks," "Sierra Leone generally had lower GHI averages," "Seasonal variations observed across all."]

## Conclusion & Next Steps
The EDA and initial cleaning phases were successful, preparing the data for further modeling. The cross-country comparison reveals distinct solar potential across the regions. Future work would involve advanced modeling and in-depth correlation analysis.
